Got it! If we're focusing on a single homestay booking page (rather than a site with multiple listings), the layout will be more focused on presenting **one specific property** and guiding the user seamlessly from **discovery** to **booking**.

Here’s a wireframe structure for a **single homestay property** booking website:

---

### 1. **Header** (Appears on all pages)

- **Logo**: Positioned top-left.
    
- **Navigation Links**: Links for "Home," "How it works," "Contact," "About."
    
- **Search Bar**: Centered with an option to search for other destinations.
    
- **Login/Sign-up**: On the top-right corner.

### 2. **Hero Section** (Main Visual Area)

- **Hero Image**: A large, high-quality image of the homestay. Ideally showing both the exterior and some interior shots.

### **Visual Design Tips**:

1. **Minimalist and Clean Layout**: Keep it simple, with plenty of whitespace so that users aren't overwhelmed.
    
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Make the _“Book Now”_ button stand out with a bold color like a bright green or blue.
    
3. **High-Quality Images**: The homestay's photos should be professional and inviting—this is key to persuading potential guests.
    
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Ensure that all elements (especially booking forms and images) are responsive and easy to navigate on mobile devices.
